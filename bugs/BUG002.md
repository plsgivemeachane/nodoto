### [BUG-002] Event-Based Request Timeout Handling Implementation
**Date**: 2024-01-24
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Component**: HTTP Server Monitoring System

### Error Stack
```typescript
Argument of type 'InteruptEvent' is not assignable to parameter of type 'RequestEvent'.
Type 'InteruptEvent' is missing the following properties from type 'RequestEvent': request, event
```

### Reproduction
1. Send a HTTP request to any endpoint
2. Wait for the request timeout duration
3. Observe that the timeout handling is incomplete
4. Check server logs for type mismatch errors

### Problem Description
Currently implementing a transition from direct response handling to an event-based system for request timeouts. The system needs to properly handle request timeouts through events instead of immediate HTTP 408 responses. This allows for more flexible timeout handling across the application.

### Affected Files
- httpServer/monitoring/TimeoutMonitor.ts
- httpServer/monitoring/event/impl/InteruptEvent.ts
- httpServer/monitoring/RequestEvent.ts
- httpServer/monitoring/EventManager.ts
- httpServer/monitoring/RequestMonitor.ts

### Current Implementation Issues
1. Type mismatch between InteruptEvent and RequestEvent interfaces
2. Commented out HTTP 408 response handling without full event-based replacement
3. Event cleanup handlers need to be properly integrated
4. Response wrapper integration needs completion
5. Event emission timing and order needs verification

### Proposed Solution
1. Complete the event-based system implementation
2. Ensure proper type compatibility between events
3. Implement proper cleanup handlers for all scenarios
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Add proper response wrapping for all scenarios

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Fix type compatibility between InteruptEvent and RequestEvent
2. [ ] Implement proper event handlers for timeout scenarios
3. [ ] Add comprehensive testing for timeout scenarios
4. [ ] Document the new event-based timeout handling system
5. [ ] Add monitoring and metrics for timeout events

### Notes
- The transition to event-based handling will improve system flexibility
- Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing timeout handling
- Consider adding configuration options for timeout behavior
